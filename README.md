autoPlantWatering.m: This project is focused on innovating and designing an automated plant watering
system to create a simpler manner of watering your plants in real time. The main objective of this
system is to monitor the soil moisture levels using the moisture sensor, which is connected to the
Arduino kit, as well as automating a water pumping system depending on the moisture levels. For
the design analysis we had to implement a good system to transport a water source to the plant
which had a sensor inside of it. I used MATLAB to plot a real-time tracking of soil moisture over time
in seconds, as well as pumping a select amount of water depending on the level of moisture in soil.
I tested this process in my plant watering setup using the Arduino and code, and the system
successfully analyzed the voltage from the soil moisture sensor and dispensed a set amount of
water for the size of the plant, all while plotting in real time. In conclusion the system worked as
wrote, although one recommendation is to analyze how to properly plot the graph in a better
manner, meaning isolated from the sensor checking itself. Thank you.

blindsAlarm.m: The Automatic Window Blinds and Alarm System is an innovative software project
designed and implemented to efficiently enhance automating blinds opening and
closing through using the Arduino kits light sensor component, led component, and
buzzer components, as well as a servo motor to apply the movement to the blinds.
This is all done while plotting voltage and state changes in real time. This is done by using different 
sunlight levels being tracked using the Arduinoâ€™s light sensor and applying the blind movement using a servo motor.
It will also provide an alarm and led when approaching a change of state A.K.A a
threshold for opening and closing blinds (e.g. Sunlight to darkness, darkness to sunlight).
This project serves as an automation process to ease daily life through small projects and at a
large scale, hopefully huge businesses.
