blindsAlarm.m: The Automatic Window Blinds and Alarm System is an innovative software project
designed and implemented to efficiently enhance automating blinds opening and
closing through using the Arduino kits light sensor component, led component, and
buzzer components, as well as a servo motor to apply the movement to the blinds.
This is all done while plotting voltage and state changes in real time. This is done by using different 
sunlight levels being tracked using the Arduinoâ€™s light sensor and applying the blind movement using a servo motor.
It will also provide an alarm and led when approaching a change of state A.K.A a
threshold for opening and closing blinds (e.g. Sunlight to darkness, darkness to sunlight).
This project serves as an automation process to ease daily life through small projects and at a
large scale, hopefully huge businesses.
