autoPlantWatering.m: This project is focused on innovating and designing an automated plant watering
system to create a simpler manner of watering your plants in real time. The main objective of this
system is to monitor the soil moisture levels using the moisture sensor, which is connected to the
Arduino kit, as well as automating a water pumping system depending on the moisture levels. For
the design analysis we had to implement a good system to transport a water source to the plant
which had a sensor inside of it. I used MATLAB to plot a real-time tracking of soil moisture over time
in seconds, as well as pumping a select amount of water depending on the level of moisture in soil.
I tested this process in my plant watering setup using the Arduino and code, and the system
successfully analyzed the voltage from the soil moisture sensor and dispensed a set amount of
water for the size of the plant, all while plotting in real time. In conclusion the system worked as
wrote, although one recommendation is to analyze how to properly plot the graph in a better
manner, meaning isolated from the sensor checking itself. Thank you.
